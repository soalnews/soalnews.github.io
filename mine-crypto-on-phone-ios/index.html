<p>That accounts for the phone�s €2900 price tag, but not the price of the mining contract. Considering that, the amount you earn will be not that much because mining requires very high rigs which your phone cannot give. Download the mobile miner app, create a wallet and start mining.

Perhaps the greatest part is that there are no fees to use these apps and no investments need to be made. They will continue to mine even if you disconnect from the internet. Apple has updated its developer guidelines to outlaw cryptocurrencies “mining” on ios devices.</p>
