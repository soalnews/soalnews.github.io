It is a technological tool set designed to simplify the process of creating secure blockchain applications on top of tendermint. From all the projects, the network already commands more than $50 billion in cumulative value. The cosmos hub is a distributed ledger where individual users or the zones themselves can hold their tokens. Cosmos’ architecture consists of several independent blockchains called “zones” attached to a central blockchain called “hub”.</p>
