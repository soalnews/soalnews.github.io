<p>A better term that describes staking is pos also short for proof of stake. Staking pools work similarly to this pooling mine process. Cryptocurrency staking is basically like being paid in interest or a reward for holding the coin. Crypto staking is an activity that allows users and crypto investors to participate in a decentralized blockchain and receive rewards for it. Cryptocurrency staking is a concept where you hold crypto in a wallet with a trusted exchange, like coinbase or binance, in order to secure transaction.</p>

<p>A pooling mine is a mining method in which more than one clients invest in the creation of a block and later the block reward is split among the clients in accordance with the investment made by them. Staking is an alternative consensus mechanism (way to verify and secure transactions) that allows users to generally secure crypto networks with minimal energy consumption and setup. As the term implies, it only applies to tokens that employ the pos consensus algorithm, such. Proof of work coins have pooling mines. Just hold some crypto and receive a reward, but there is a lot more involved.</p>

<p>Staking, on the other hand, provides users with a chance to earn coins without the need to. The concept of staking is related to “proof of stake” (pos), and it therefore involves only newer coins like neo, stellar, ontology, vechain There are many popular currencies that have this feature, but not all. Crypto staking is the act of holding a specific number of supported tokens for a period of time in the hope of earning rewards, and at the same time, contributing to the tokens’ governance. As a core tenet of decentralized finance, staking ensures the smooth operation of a blockchain by providing incentives for users to hold their assets in a crypto wallet.</p>
