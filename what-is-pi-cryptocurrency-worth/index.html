<p>But is it worth it at all, does it seem like a scam? The price of pi is $1,7308. Pi coin on my app call you “pioneers” who will earn at about 0.8 pie/hr rate, while by the time it hit 1 million, the rate is halved. This did not come to pass, and the value is currently $0.00. The exchange predicted that pi network value will be $0.16 by the beginning of 2020.</p>
